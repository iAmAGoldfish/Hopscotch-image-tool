# Hopscotch-image-tool

A javascript tool to turn an image into Hopscotch pixel art code.

to use, add a block to a Hopscotch project (For example, move forward 5555).
Copy the json to somewhere editable. Find that block's code. Delete it and add the output of this tool.

Currently, there is a bug in Hopscotch which means that this code won't work unless you set the version attribute of the json file to 24.


Also you can do fast draw by replacing an ability, but only with a draw a taril block. It also does not automatically add your code for you.
