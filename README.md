A javascript tool to turn an image into Hopscotch pixel art code.

to use, add a block to a Hopscotch project (For example, move forward 5555).
Copy the json to somewhere editable. Find that block's code. Delete it and add the output of this tool.

Currently, there is a bug in Hopscotch which means that this code won't work unless you set the version attribute of the json file to 24.
